Hot N Cold (Algorithm).

-Read the temperature.
-If temperature is in Farenheit, convert it to Celsius with the following formula:
-Subtract thee degrees Farenheit 32 and multiply by .5556, e.g ("x"°F - 32) * .5556 = "x"°C.
-If temperature is in Celsius, convert it to Farenheit with the following formula:
-Multiply de degrees Celsius by 1.8 and add 32; e.g ("x"°C * 1.8) + 32 = "x"°F.

Some geometry (Algorithm)

**Volume for a cube**
-Take the measure of all three equal sides of the cube and multiply all; e.g Volume of Cube = "a" x "a" x "a"

**Volume for a pyramid**
- Take the measure of its base length and multiply it by 1/3.
-Then multiply by its base widht and finallly by its height.

**Volume for an sphere**
-Multiply 4/3 by the result of the third power of Pi(π).
-(4/3)πr3
